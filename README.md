# Spring-Boot 

I used webstorm(vue.js) as this was the most appropriate for reading vue.js syntax and allowed me to edit the webpage whilst having the web
browser open

Spring Boot(Backend) was a must use and the most suitable for creating my backend with vue.js(frontend) 
H2 Databse was easy to interegrate with spring boot, this made it easier to show you a perseistent and working backend.
